# 🚀 Deduct Inventory Function Improvements

## ✅ Enhanced Features Implemented

```php
'reason' => 'required|in:damaged,expired,theft,adjustment,recall,quality_control,shrinkage,other'
```

**Available Reasons:**
- 🔨 **Damaged Inventory** - Physical damage, water damage, etc.

- 🚨 **Theft/Loss** - Security incidents
- ⚠️ **Product Recall** - Manufacturer/regulatory recalls
- 🔧 **Other** - Custom reasons with notes

### 2. **Smart Batch Selection**
- **Manual Batch Targeting**: Specify exact batch ID to deduct from
- **FIFO (First In, First Out)**: Automatically selects oldest batch if no batch specified
- **Batch Context in Audit Trail**: All deductions include batch information

### 3. **Approval Workflow for Large Deductions**
```php
$requiresApproval = $request->quantity > 100 || in_array($request->reason, ['theft', 'recall']);
```

**Triggers Admin Approval:**
- ✅ Quantities over 100 units
- ✅ Theft-related deductions
- ✅ Product recall deductions

### 4. **Enhanced Audit Trail**
```php
$detailedNote = $reasonMessages[$request->reason];
if ($request->notes) {
    $detailedNote .= ' - ' . $request->notes;
}
if ($request->batch_id) {
    $detailedNote .= " (Batch: {$request->batch_id})";
}
```

**Improved Stock History Records:**

}
```

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Specific error messages with actual quantities
- ✅ Batch-specific error handling
- ✅ Product availability validation
- ✅ Notes character limit (500 chars)

### 6. **Smart Low Stock Alerting**
```php
// Check total quantity across all batches for this product
$totalQuantity = Inventory::where('product_id', $product->id)->sum('quantity');

if ($totalQuantity <= 20) {
    Mail::to('admin@example.com')->send(new LowStockAlert(...));
}
```

**Enhanced Alerts:**
