    echo "   - Wholesalers should see the full product catalog\n";

    echo "🔧 SOLUTION APPROACH:\n";
    echo "   Option 1: Set ALL products to seller_role='factory' initially\n";
    echo "   Option 2: Use NULL seller_role for factory products\n";

    echo "   1. Factory has ALL products available\n";
    echo "   2. Wholesalers can purchase ANY product from factory\n";

    echo "   - Products start as 'factory' (available to wholesalers)\n";
    echo "   - When wholesaler buys, system creates 'wholesaler' availability for retailers\n";
