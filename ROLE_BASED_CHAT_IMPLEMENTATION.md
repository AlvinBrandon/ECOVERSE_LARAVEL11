# Role-Based Chat System Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of a role-based chat system in the Ecoverse Laravel application that enforces specific conversation rules between different user types.

## Chat Interaction Rules

### ðŸ“‹ Conversation Matrix

| Role        | Can Chat With                     | Cannot Chat With              |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Admin**   | Supplier, Wholesaler, Staff      | Retailer, Customer           |
| **Supplier**| Admin only                        | Wholesaler, Retailer, Customer, Staff |
| **Wholesaler**| Admin, Retailer, Staff         | Supplier, Customer           |
| **Retailer**| Customer, Wholesaler             | Admin, Supplier, Staff       |
| **Customer**| Retailer only                    | Admin, Supplier, Wholesaler, Staff |
| **Staff**   | Admin, Wholesaler                | Supplier, Retailer, Customer |

## Implementation Details

### 1. Controller Updates (`ChatController.php`)

#### New Methods Added:
- `getAllowedChatUsers($user)` - Returns users that current user can chat with
- `canUsersChat($user1, $user2)` - Validates if two users can chat based on roles
- `selectUser()` - Shows user selection interface
- `startDirectChat()` - Initiates direct chat between users

#### Enhanced Methods:
- `start()` - Updated to use role-based user filtering
- `createRoom()` - Added role validation before room creation

### 2. Model Updates (`ChatRoom.php`)

#### Enhanced Methods:
- `userHasAccess()` - Now validates role-based access to chat rooms
- `canUsersChat()` - Added duplicate method for model-level validation

### 3. New Views

#### `resources/views/chat/select-user.blade.php`
- Professional user selection interface
- Role-based filtering of available users
- Direct messaging capability
- Visual role indicators with color coding

### 4. Route Updates (`routes/web.php`)

#### New Routes Added:
```php
Route::get('/select-user', [ChatController::class, 'selectUser'])->name('selectUser');
Route::post('/start-direct', [ChatController::class, 'startDirectChat'])->name('startDirectChat');
```

### 5. Updated Navigation

#### Chat Index View Updates:
- Added "Message User" option for direct messaging
- Renamed "Start New Chat" to "Support Chat" for clarity
